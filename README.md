# Brainiac
A minimal machine learning library from scratch in C++


## Status

Offers classifier models for supervised learning of csv datasets and Image datasets, primarily following the MNIST dataset format. Includes KNN, Kmeans and a Classifier Neural Network.
Plan to generalise the imgdata handlers and include neural networks for unsupervised clustering and reinforcement learning.

## Benchmarks

<b>Using the MNIST data set: </b> Average training time for an epoch of 6000 images = 110 seconds

For 10 epochs of training over 6000 images per epoch, Accuracy of prediction ~= 61%.
Can expect much higher results for a 100+ epochs with 60000 imgs per epoch
